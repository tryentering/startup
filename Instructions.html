      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Flower Skull is played in rounds. The game ends when any player wins two rounds.</p>
      <p>Each round has four phases: Set Up, Playing Cards, Bidding, and Followthrough.</p>

      <h2>Phase 1: Set Up</h2>
      <p>At the beginning of the game all players will have a hand of three flowers and one skull.</p>
      <p>Each round starts off with each player laying down one card, beginning their personal stack.</p>
      <p>Whenever you play a card, it will be unknown to your opponents.</p>

      <h2>Phase 2: Playing Cards</h2>
      <p>In this phase of the game you will choose between playing a card, or starting the bidding phase.</p>
      <p>If you play a card, you will place it on top of your stack</p>
      <p>If you choose to begin bidding, you will not play a card</p>

      <h2>Phase 3: Bidding</h2>
      <p>In this phase of the game you will bid on how many flower cards you can uncover before uncovering a skull from the cards that have been played.</p>
      <p>On your turn you must either bid higher than the previous player, or drop out of the round.</p>
      <p>Once one player remains in the bid they will continue to the followthrough phase.</p>

  <a href="#slide6" id="slide5" class="Followthrough">
    <section>
      <div>
      </div>
      <h2>Phase 4: Followthrough</h2>
      <p>In this phase you (who won the bid) will now attempt to reveal the number
        of flower cards you bid without overturning a skull card</p>
        <p>If you flip over a skull card, you have lost the round. As a consequence you will discard a card from your hand.</p>
      <p>You will begin by revealing the cards from your stack, one at a time.</p>
     <p>If you have flipped all the cards from your stack and have not met your bid, you will now begin revealing cards from your opponent's stacks</p>
    <p>You may choose any of your opponent's stacks and alternate between them, but you can only ever flip the top card of their stack. </p>
    <p>If you meet your bid, you have won the round! Congratulations</p>

        <h1>End Game</h1>
        <p>Again, a player wins the game after winning two rounds. <br>If a player loses a round (i.e. wins the bidding but cannot meet their bid) they discard a card for the remainder of the game</p>
