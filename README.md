Playing games with family and friends is always a good time. Unfortunately having an enjoyable experience can be tough because of the inconvienence of lugging around the box, lost pieces, set up, and clean up. Sometimes getting all the people you want to play with is plain impossible. Now with the flowerskull website, you can play a fun game without needing to be with the people you are playing with, and without dealing with the inconvience of keeping track of your copy of the game.
